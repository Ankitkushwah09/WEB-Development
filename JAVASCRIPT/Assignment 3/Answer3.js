Loops are control structures in programming that allow us to iterate or repeat a
 block of code multiple times. They are used when we want to perform a specific action
  repeatedly, either for a fixed number of times or until a certain condition is met.

JavaScript provides several types of loops, including:

for Loop:

Syntax:
   for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
  // code block to be executed
  }

*/

//Example:

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }

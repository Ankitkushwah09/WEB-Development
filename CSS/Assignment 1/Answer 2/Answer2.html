  <!-- 1. The main container div with class content provides a maximum width and centers the content.

    
       2. The paragraphs have unique class names following the BEM convention: content__paragraph, content__paragraph--highlighted, and content__paragraph--special.
          content__paragraph: This class represents a regular paragraph.
          content__paragraph--highlighted: This class represents a paragraph that should be highlighted.
          content__paragraph--special: This class represents a paragraph with special styling (in this case, italicized text).


          By using BEM, we create a clear and structured naming convention for our classes, making it easy to understand their purpose and ensuring maintainability in larger projects. -->

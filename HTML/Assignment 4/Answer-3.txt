Web Accessibility:
Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:

1.perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
2.contribute to the Web


Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:

1.auditory
2.cognitive
3.neurological
4.physical
5.speech
6.visual


Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:

1.people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
2.older people with changing abilities due to ageing
3.people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses
4.people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio
5.people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth



Accessibility is Important for Individuals, Businesses, Society


The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. Access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, is defined as a basic human right in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD).

The Web offers the possibility of unprecedented access to information and interaction for many people with disabilities. That is, the accessibility barriers to print, audio, and visual media can be much more easily overcome through web technologies.

Accessibility supports social inclusion for people with disabilities as well as others, such as:

1.older people
2.people in rural areas
3.people in developing countries

There is also a strong business case for accessibility.Accessible design improves overall user experience and satisfaction, especially in a variety of situations, across different devices, and for older users. Accessibility can enhance your brand, drive innovation, and extend your market reach.
